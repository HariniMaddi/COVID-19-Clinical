# Comparison of Deep Learning Approaches to Predict COVID-19 Clinical Severity

The SARS-CoV2 virus, which causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) has become a pandemic and has expanded all over the world.  Because of increasing number of cases day by day, it takes time to interpret the clinical findings thus the limitations in terms of both treatment and findings are emerged. 
Due to such limitations, the need for clinical decisions making system with predictive algorithms has arisen.
Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on healthcare systems by identifying the diseases. 
In this study, we perform clinical predictive models that estimate, using deep learning and clinical data, which patients are likely to receive a COVID-19 disease. 
To evaluate the predictive performance of our models, precision, F1-score, recall, AUC, and accuracy scores calculated. 
Models were tested with 18 clinical features from 600 patients and validated with 10 fold cross-validation and train-test split approaches. 
The experimental results indicate that our predictive models identify patients that have COVID-19 disease at an accuracy of 86.66%, F1-score of 91.89%, precision of 86.75%, recall of 99.42%, and AUC of 62.50%. 
It is observed that predictive models trained on clinical findings could be used to predict clinical pathways for COVID-19, and can be helpful for medical experts to prioritize the resources correctly.
